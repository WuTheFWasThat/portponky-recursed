bring room in well,

L(N, jar) = room with arbitrary jar at N and 1 green left
S(N) = room with S(N-1) at N and 1 green left

MAKE L(N, J) where BLOCK AT N-1 =
  bring J into room, make jar J'
  make L(N-1, J')
  go inside
  jump into J' (at N-1)

  go in S(N-1) at N-1
  go in S(N-2) at N-2...
  ...
  bring block out to N-2, jar up to

MAKE S(N) =


MAKE L2 =
  go in room, bring block down
  make jar
  bring jar in room, put at right side (l1)
  make jar
  bring in room, bring to l1.  make jar
  bring in room, bring to l1.  jump in jar
  go in jar, bring block out, drop at l1
  make jar, bring to l2
  make jar

MAKE L4 =
  MAKE L2
  MAKE L2 (almost)

MAKE L2

NEED
  bring main jar to l2, make jar
  outside: move block to l2
  bring another jar in, bring main jar to l3
  use other to bring block to l3, jar to l4
  make jar
  outside: move block to l4
  bring another jar in, bring main jar to l5
  use other to bring block to l4, jar to l5

  go into jar, retrieve block.  take key out.
  ... block is stuck??
