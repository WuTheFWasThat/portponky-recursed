room 1 = oobleck
room 2 = key/block

take out oob from 1
grab room 2
make copy of 1
bring 1 into 2
get 3 oobs, grab block, get key
bring into 1
unlock,
bring out to entrance
exit, copy room 1, bring back in

// at this point you can easily make paradox (see below)

repeatedly:
  copy room 1
  bring into room 2
    get 3 oobs from room 1
    touch block
    get key
    exit

// paradox
    creation:
      exit to top level, bring room 1 into room 1
      take room 1 into room 2, then into room 1
    solve:

      go in room, take key out, go back in, unlock x2, jar
      go in room, take key out, go in jar, move fan to entrance

      exit

      go in room, take key out, go back in, unlock x2, jar
      go in room, hold fan, make jar
      bring first jar into second
      bring jar up, bring key up and into jar
      unlock, move fan to end, exit
      grab fan, exit

      get fan back... hopefully you know how by now  :)
