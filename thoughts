personally not a fan of mechanics heavy stuff

SOLVEd

uphill crystal is great, very cleverly designed.
diamond was relatively simple, but why are there 2 keys in the key room?

downhill is also a great level.

high tide crystal:  exposes weird water mechanics.  i had to use the glitch room, i assume this was intended
solid level, not spectacular

locky triad is unnecessarily tedious
diamond is decent

deficient crystal: decent but not particularly interesting/different

advanced sluice:
i threw the box from the left and came out midair.  i assume intended; if so, i didnt like this puzzle
diamond: funny level, slightly unfair but i think appropriate

aqua: didnt like much.  pretty straightforward, except maybe the clutch trick

UNSOLVED

cell: interesting mechanics, double globals.  plus the funny "hiding" trick

the diamond seems impossible, though interesting

igloo: daunting
