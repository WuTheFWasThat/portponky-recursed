I posted a level in the other pinned thread, could you add it to the list?

I've been playing these custom levels a bit the last 2 (edit: N) days.  There are lots of good ideas in there.  Here's some feedback:

[spoiler]
=========
SOLVED
=========

is_this_easy_mode: easy mode was easy.  I enjoyed the idea of the diamond a lot.  I'm not entirely sure if i have the intended solution - mine is *very* long-winded, making a paradox via the giltch room, then going back in the glitch room to retrieve the green room.  many times i used a long subroutine to retrieve a block - it'd be nice if that was made simple, assuming I had the intended solution.  Also, I was frequently annoyed by the placement of things in the level, such as the small gaps where you can get stuck if you misplace the blocks underneath you

uphill: crystal is great, very cleverly designed.  diamond was relatively simple, but why are there 2 keys in the key room?

downhill: also a great level.

cliff: a decent level

drop: funny level, i liked it. feels impossible at first but theres only really one thing to do and ends up not too hard.  I used the clutch trick, which seems to show up too much.. this level should probably be renamed since the last tapestry has a level of the same name

barter: good level. seemed very hard for a good while (but again uses clutch trick?).  While I enjoyed it, I should note that I solved it by guessing that the puzzle maker wanted me to hide the oobleck in a jar.  From there, I reasoned I must need 2 blocks.  Then i realized the ending sequence which makes it work

high tide crystal:  exposes weird water mechanics.  i had to use the glitch room, i assume this was intended. solid level, not spectacular

locky triad: is unnecessarily tedious. diamond is decent, not great

deficient crystal: decent but not particularly interesting/different.  if the main room is used for the diamond somehow then this is very understandable

advanced sluice: i threw the box from the left and came out midair.  i assume this is intended.  i'm not a fan of this style of puzzle; I think it would be appropriate maybe in a group of levels with similar "unfair" solutions, like the void
diamond: funny level - seemed impossible at first, and I suspected unfairness. but in the end, i didn't find it unfair, and enjoyed the solution

aqua: didnt like much.  pretty straightforward, except maybe the clutch trick

squash: didnt like this one. maybe I found an unintended solution - it was rather mechanics heavy with no real idea.  also maybe i'm wrong, but i think the level would be no different if the block were accessible outside the aqua morta

exhibition crystal: simple and pretty easy, but nice idea.  perfect lead up to diamond.
exhibition diamond:  i was so sure the clutch trick would solve it.. instead it was much better!  if i am correct, it uses the mechanics of exiting a green room while holding itself, which is not used anywhere else.  overall, exhibition is one of my favorites

cell: double globals is new, though it seems they behave as you'd expect. funny trick to hide from acid - I realized it right away. but somehow I got stuck for awhile after that, although it was simple in the end. my excuse is... I was expecting something harder.  the final jump is unnecessarily hard - why not make the left ledge stick out more?
cell diamond:  was quite tricky to get into paradox - i wouldn't have found it if i didnt know it existed.  the paradox itself is a decent level.  but there are also some weird facts explored here, like that the fan doesn't blow while on a block, and that the green items attempt to spawn in the beginning of loading a room, which I think makes for a worse experience.  overall i didn't find the mechanics too questionable in the end, but slightly so

too much secure: this took me way too long - after being stuck on it for awhile, i took a long break doing other puzzles.  finally when i came back, it seemed quite easy. ok but not particularly interesting.

=========
TRIED BUT UNSOLVED
=========

deficient diamond: seems impossible.. i'm sorta intrigued, but also expecting something sort of unfair.

igloo: daunting - i have no idea what to do but it seems impossible.  also seems like it will be hard even when i realize why it's impossible

mutual: i like it, seems very tricky though; havent spent enough time yet

dive: not sure what to do

advanced escalate: ... havent given it a real go

low tide: simple but seems tricky

[/spoiler]

EDIT: i have been updating this as i finish more levels
