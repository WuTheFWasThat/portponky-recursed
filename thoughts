personally not a fan of mechanics heavy stuff

SOLVEd

uphill crystal is great, very cleverly designed.
diamond was relatively simple, but why are there 2 keys in the key room?

downhill is also a great level.

cliff was a decent level

drop: funny level, i liked it, though not too hard.  feels impossible but theres only one thing to do

high tide crystal:  exposes weird water mechanics.  i had to use the glitch room, i assume this was intended
solid level, not spectacular

locky triad is unnecessarily tedious
diamond is decent

deficient crystal: decent but not particularly interesting/different

advanced sluice:
i threw the box from the left and came out midair.  i assume intended; if so, i'm not a fan of this style of puzzle, although it would be appropriate maybe in a group of levels with similar "unfair" solutions
diamond: funny level - seemed impossible at first.  in the end, i didn't find it unfair, and enjoyed the solution

aqua: didnt like much.  pretty straightforward, except maybe the clutch trick

UNSOLVED

cell: interesting mechanics, double globals.  plus the funny "hiding" trick

the diamond seems impossible, though interesting

is_this_easy_mode: easy mode was easy.  havent given the diamond much thought

too much secure: seems quite hard

igloo: daunting - i have no idea what to do but it seems impossible.  also seems like it will be hard even when i realize why it's impossible
