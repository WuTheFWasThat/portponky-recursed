take gcauldron into groom
jump in gcauldron
take cauldron in room
take groom into cauldron, drop
exit

hmm? gcauldron in room, jump in gcauldron

LOGIC
to get fan to L2, two possibilities:
- remove fan from room
  - fan is in room and thus not in L1.  thus room came from cauldron, so
    cauldron was on L2 (room could come from another room but that's useless for
    retrieving green)
- remove fan from cauldron
  - fan is in other cauldron and thus not in L1
    thus cauldron came from room? but how did room get up there?
    - need 2 rooms in root-room?
CONSTRAINT:
impossible to have character + something at L2 without fan at L1
