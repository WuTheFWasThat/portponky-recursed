go in room2
take block into  room1
take block into  room2

PARADOX

go in room2
take block into  room1
take block into  room2
drop
go in room 1
take out room2
jump up, exit

==
go in room1
go in room2, get fan, take out
put room2 on ledge
go in room2, get fan, take out
bring fan in, retrieve room1
retrieve another fan
throw room2 left
go in room1
go in room2, get fan, take out
go back in room 2
leave fan by room 1, go in room 1, retrieve room 2
take fan, jump into room2
put room2 into room1, at top
exit (paradox again)
  now it's easy!
